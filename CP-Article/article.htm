<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Tags</strong> = Javascript, ReactJS, CRUD, frosting, HTML5, Typescript,</p>

<p>The LibreGrid component, which I&#39;ve built on top of React allows you to View, Sort, Search, Edit and generate JSON from your custom Domain Object(s).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>One Requirement For Use</h3>

<p>You must have a collection of your Domain Objects: Your domain objects must be contained in an array.&nbsp; This is very common format that is used by 99% of WebAPIs anyways so this shouldn&#39;t cause you any problem.&nbsp; This just means that your JSON will be in the format of :</p>

<pre lang="jscript">
// [ ] represents outer array
// each { } represents each domain object
[ 
&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;fake-prop&quot;: &quot;fake-value 1&quot;
&nbsp; },
&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;fake-prop&quot;: &quot;fake-value 2&quot;
&nbsp; }
]</pre>

<p>Believe it or not, using just that simple data, I can show you how easy it is to load the LibreGrid with your custom data.&nbsp; It may not seem amazing yet, but when we load the results from a custom WebAPI I believe you&#39;ll be amazed.&nbsp; I hope so.</p>

<h2>Let Me Show You How Easy It Is To Use LibreGrid</h2>

<p>Now, for the fast crowd, let me show you how easily you can use my <code>LibreGrid</code> component.</p>

<p>Then, after I show you it in action, we&#39;ll come back here and learn a bit more about how it works.</p>

<h3>Ugly User Interface</h3>

<p>I actually made the UI quite ugly for now for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
	<li>I don&#39;t want the reader to focus on what it all looks like right now</li>
	<li>It&#39;s extremely easy to add a layer of CSS which will make your implementation of the LibreGrid component beautiful.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Parent &amp; Child React Component</h4>

<p>The image that follows shows the UI with two main headers (one black one &amp; one green one).&nbsp; Those headers each define the area of a separate React component</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>DataLoader</strong> - The parent React component which I built for this article so you can see the LibreGrid in action.&nbsp; The DataLoader&#39;s content ends with the [Load Data] button.

	<ul>
		<li>DataLoader is made up of a number of HTML Input controls (all text boxes except the one checkbox and the one [Load Data] button).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>LibreGrid</strong> - Everything within the Green border is the LibreGrid (the target component we are discussing).
	<ul>
		<li>I&#39;ve added the LibreGrid as a child component to the example so we can pass in data from the parent (DataLoader).<br />
		This is where your Domain Model data will be displayed for sorting, searching, editing &amp; generating altered JSON.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>DataLoader - Component Which Uses LibreGrid</h3>

<p>Again, I&#39;ve created the DataLoader entirely so I can show you how easy it is to load data into the LibreGrid &amp; use it in your own projects and your own domain objects.</p>

<p>First, of all, you can see that when the app runs it initially loads some sa mple data (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flintstones">based on Flintstones cartoon characters</a>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flintstones" target="_blank" title="New Window">^</a>]).&nbsp; We can just ignore that for now.</p>

<h4>Focus On Three HTML Text Input Boxes</h4>

<p>To begin, we will just use three of the HTML text input fields to load our data.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Data</strong> - text input where we&#39;ll paste our JSON which represents our array of domain objects</li>
	<li><strong>Fields</strong> - text input where we&#39;ll type an array of strings which represent the field names which are found in the domain objects</li>
	<li><strong>Column Headers</strong> - text input where we&#39;ll type an array of strings which will represent the header text which will appear above each column in our LibreGrid.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What&#39;s The Big Deal?</h2>

<p>At first when you see this you may think it&#39;s no big deal.&nbsp; I understand.&nbsp; At first it doesn&#39;t look like much, but you get a lot of features and I&#39;ll show you those features in just a moment.&nbsp; First, just allow me to point out a few things you may find odd.</p>

<h3>A Few Important Things to Notice</h3>

<ol>
	<li><strong>ID Column</strong> - If the data doesn&#39;t have an ID column (just a numeric incrementable column) then I add one.&nbsp; If the data does have the value we can handle that too.</li>
	<li><strong>Sort</strong> - The data is initially sorted on the ID column in ascending fashion. However, all you have to do to sort the data is click on the column header.</li>
	<li><strong>Allow Data Reset</strong> -- You&#39;ll see more about this in a moment but it is just a way to allow the child LibreGrid component to only reload data if the user wants it to so we don&#39;t wipe out changes they&#39;ve made to the data.</li>
	<li><strong>Headers</strong> - Headers are just an array of strings.&nbsp; If you add no headers you won&#39;t get any text over the columns and you won&#39;t have a way to click to sort the data.&nbsp; You can also use the exact same array of strings you used for the Field Names but you don&#39;t have to. Fields have to match the domain object&#39;s property names, but headers are just text which is displayed.</li>
</ol>

<p>With all of that in mind, let&#39;s go one step further now and load data from a WebAPI to prove this thing can work with any array of data objects.</p>
